      <h2>Game Rules</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Snap Game! The rules are simple:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Players take turns playing cards from their hands.</li>
        <li>If two consecutive cards match, the first player to shout "SNAP!" wins both piles.</li>
        <li>The game continues until one or more players run out of cards.</li>
        <li>The player(s) with the most points at the end of the game wins.</li>
      </ol>
